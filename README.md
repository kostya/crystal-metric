# Crystal Metric

This is set of 26 benchmarks for Crystal language, in one file. Program were taken from my benchmarks: [jit-benchmarks](https://github.com/kostya/jit-benchmarks), [crystal-benchmarks-game](https://github.com/kostya/crystal-benchmarks-game), [benchmarks](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks) and from Crystal samples. Benchmarks implemented as separated classes, this is good for test multi module compilation.

## Run

```
crystal build metric.cr --release
./metric
```
